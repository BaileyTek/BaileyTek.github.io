        <h2>My current Job</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a Teir 1 Technical Support Engineer at a BPO Company. We assist residents or customers with their internet and cable issues. We assist them remotely over the phone, by providing them instructions for their physical connection and together with the registration process on a specific site.We used different tools and each account we have has their own different webpages for the services they offer. Each webpages has their own creative UI. Some are user friendly, some are not so. From then on I start to wonder, what if I could also create a website that could have a better UI and is also responsive. That's where I started to consider my first love... coding and programming.
