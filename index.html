        <h2>My current Job</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a <span id='job'>Teir 1 Technical Support Engineer</span> at a BPO Company. We assist residents or customers with their internet and cable issues. We assist them remotely over the phone, by providing them instructions for their physical connection and together with the registration process on a specific site. We used different tools and each account we have has different web pages for the services they offer. Each webpage has its creative UI. Some are user-friendly, some are not so. From then on I start to wonder, what if I could also create a website that could have a better UI and is also responsive. That's the point when I started to consider my first love... coding and programming.

        <h2>Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My programming/coding journey started way back in high school when we were introduced to VisualBasic where I was so astonished by how a simple code could do. Starting that day I said to myself to learn other programming languages. From then on until college I've encountered other programming languages such as java, c++, c#, and python, for different applications like for microcontrollers such as Arduino, Zolertia, and Adafruit.<br>
          Unfortunately, I got lost in the track of my coding and programming journey until my friend introduced me back to programming. She introduced me to web development, and it hooked me. So while working as a technical support engineer, I started learning the basics of front-end web development on freeCodeCamp, w3schoo, and some crash courses on youtube during my day off and free time. After getting enough mastery of front-end web development, I will continue my journey until I get to learn the full stack development. It might be a long road, but by taking one step at a time, I know, I'll get there.
